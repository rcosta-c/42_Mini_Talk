## 📝 Description

**Mini-talk** project is part of the 42 Porto curriculum and teaches how to use Unix signals for inter-process communication. This is a project that enables communication between two different processes using Unix signals such as `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`. This project teaches signal handling and the implementation of a rudimentary message exchange system between processes. 

## 🚀 Features

- Send and receive messages from a client process to a server process.
- Communication based on Unix signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`).
- Robust implementation of asynchronous string transmission from client to server.
